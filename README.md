MusicPlayer is a simple Android music player app built using Kotlin. It scans local audio files on the device, displays them in a list, and allows users to play, pause, and navigate through tracks with a clean and minimal user interface. The app leverages Androidâ€™s MediaPlayer API and handles runtime permissions for accessing media storage.
